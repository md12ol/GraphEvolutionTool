/**
 * Kevin's first task:
 * 1. Write a dummy fitness method to be used on Graph's (i.e return the number of edges)
 * 
 * 2. Initialize a population of 10 representations (think of this as SDAs)
 * kev note - What is meant by representations (Where is the initial pop being initialized)
 * 
 * 3. Print the fitness values of the population to console (before evolution)
 * 4. Run 100 mating events
 * 5. Print the fitness values of the population to console (after evolution) (each mating event)
